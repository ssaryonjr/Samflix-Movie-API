<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> React, Node, MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, Socket.io, React Query, HTML & CSS.</b> This project was inspired directly from popular platforms such as Facebook and iMessage, I decided to construct my own version of the software that everday people use to connect with others around the world daily. 


<b>Frontend:</b>
- I needed a framework that would give me the ability to create fast user interfaces with complex designs and modularity across my frontend, and for that React was a no brainer!
- One of the main tools I used on the front end was React Query for state managment. The reason I went with React Query over a tool like Redux was because ReactQuery gives a better developer experience for handling API request from the server side & caching while also not having so much boilerplate code.
- Through the means of levarging powerful technologies such as web sockets provided by socket.io I was able to create two way connections between the client and the server which opens up the ability for users to have real time messaging sent and received with very low latency. 

## Features
- Mobile, Desktop, iPad, Tablets & other device type friendly.

## Lessons Learned
This was my first <i><b>big</b></i> full stack project so the learning curve for putting things together was steep. For starters, I built two to three smaller React projects before this just so I can get the hang of writing code in React. I've spent a lot of time planning, researching, reading on the best way to structure such a project. I've learned and implemented the MVC (model-view-controller) archeticture structure and from doing so I grasp a greater understanding for why this software archetictual pattern is so popular. I enjoyed the process of making this and learned a ton over the course of building this project. I now understand the hype over typescript because I was so fustrated when I tried running my code in production and I was getting so many error codes that wasn't showing up during development. I dived head in first in this project knowing only HMTL, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of React and came out being able to confidently use react and the tools in its eco system to produce fast and complex user interfaces. On the backend I had a tougher time in the beginning because I was so used to visually seeing the results of the things I coded. After reading a lot of documentation and a few youtube videos I was able to grasp a better understanding of how the server talks to the API and fetch data from the database and sends it to the front end. This was one of the funnest projects I've built thus far and it gave me the confidence to build anything! 

## Future Optimizations:
- Refactor in React.
- Use local storage to allow users to star their favorite movies and show it in a different navigation page.
- Implement lazy loading for images.
